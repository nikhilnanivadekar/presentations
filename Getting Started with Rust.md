Getting Started with Rust


# Abstract

Rust focuses on speed, safety, semantics, and productivity. Rust can be considered a multi-paradigm language. As a Java developer, Nikhil had to learn the same concepts and use them differently. In the 100% hands on talk, Nikhil will explain the basics of Rust, some different yet cool features the sets Rust apart from other programming languages. The audience will learn some of the basic concepts, advantages, disadvantages of Rust and decide if they would like to "Get started with Rust".

# Agenda

In this talk, I plan to live code and explain 
- Data types
- Memory Management
- Ownership (in other words scope)
- Comparison with Java
- Some gotchas

Learning Rust as a Java developer was an interesting and enjoyable experience. I would like to share the knowledge with the audience.
