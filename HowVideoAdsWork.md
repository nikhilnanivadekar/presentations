# Abstract
We see them on TV, we see them on our phone, it is rare to not have seen a video ad. But rarely do we take a step back and ask how does it work? 
Video ads work differently than image ads and pose interesting technical challenges that are solved creatively. In this talk, the audience will learn in-depth about video ads, and next time they see a video ad, they will be able to visualize the inner workings and say "I know how this video ad works"
